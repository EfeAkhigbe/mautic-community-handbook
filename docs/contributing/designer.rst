Hello, designer. Welcome to the Mautic Community!

Currently, we don't have many designers actively contributing to Mautic, so it's a great way for you to make a big difference. Thank you for considering contributing to Mautic. We're super excited to have you join us!

.. vale on

You could contribute to Mautic as a designer in several ways, depending on what you love doing and how your skills might best be used with the current projects.

Some areas you may want to consider:

- Supporting the Product Team by creating visual resources to explain new features
- Helping the Marketing Team with designing their monthly newsletters
- Creating new designs for Mautic's web resources (for example, the `Mautic's`_ website)
  
  .. _Mautic's: https://www.mautic.org  
- Working with the Product Team to improve the user experience of Mautic 
- Contributing to Strategic Initiatives by designing the user experience for new features
- Improving the user documentation by creating illustrations or images that complement the written information
- Building a pattern library to standardize the UI patterns used in Mautic
- Joining the User Experience Tiger Team

Getting started
***************

The first step is to join :xref:`Mautic Community Slack`.

Design tasks are primarily cross-project rather than specific to a team. You're most welcome to join whatever channels that interest you.

We recommend you join the :xref:`Mautic design team Slack` channel on Slack, where we'll post requests for people who might be interested in working on design-related tasks. Please introduce yourself in this channel and let us know how you'd like to get involved. If you don't know yet, that's also fine. We can help you find your way!

Finding tasks to work on
************************

Jira issues
===========

The best way to find issues to work on is to look at Mautic's Jira boards. There are two main ways to find tasks of interest:

- Search for :xref:`Jira issues label design`
- Search for :xref:`Jira issues text phrase design`

An issue on Jira is generally associated with a team or project board. It's a good idea to join the relevant Slack channel and let people know that you're interested in tackling the specific task you've found.

.. hint::

  All of Mautic's teams in Slack have a channel prefixed with #t-, initiatives with #i-, tiger teams with #tt-, and working groups with #wg-.

If you haven't done so, you can :xref:`Jira create account`. If you already have an account and need to be added to Mautic's instance, please ask in the :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel on Slack.

Once you log into Mautic's instance, you can assign the issue to yourself and add comments. Please transition the status as you work on it, and if you need to chunk the task down into smaller parts, make sure to add sub-tasks.

The teams generally meet fortnightly and asynchronously on Slack for teams, working groups, and tiger teams. This is a great opportunity to report to the team what you’re working on and how you’re progressing and to let people know if you need feedback.

GitHub issues and pull requests
===============================

The best way to find tasks that require input relating to the user experience or user interface within Mautic (the product) is to look at the GitHub issue queue and pull requests.

- Search the GitHub issue queue for :xref:`Mautic UX issues` or :xref:`Mautic UI issues` issues
- Search GitHub pull requests to find new features and bug fixes to test relating to :xref:`Mautic UX pull requests` or :xref:`Mautic UI pull requests` improvements

These issues are reported by Mautic users or developers who have found problems with its aspects. Pull requests are fixes for bugs or new features that have been submitted to the community for review. If they are approved, they'll be released in a future version of Mautic.

If you're able to provide feedback on issues or pull requests, please add a comment in the feed. If you can test the pull request and provide feedback from the design perspective, please click 'files changed' at the right and then 'start review'. That way, you can approve, request changes, or leave a comment after reviewing.

General principles to follow
****************************

Whenever you design for the Mautic Community, you must share the source files in the :xref:`Mautic Google Drive`.

Any images you use must have the appropriate copyright permissions, and you should share them with the team lead so that they have a copy of the licenses.

If you're working on web-based tools, please ensure that you work with a personal account where possible (so that it'll remain accessible if you move jobs) and share full access with the relevant team lead so that they can interact with the resources. Ask the team lead if there is a community account or team that they can add you to before you start working with a specific tool.

Reporting problems with design
******************************

Positive, constructive feedback on a design is always welcome. It’s even better if it includes a proposal for fixing the issue.

=========================

If you have spotted something that needs to be addressed within Mautic, please:

1. Create :xref:`GitHub create an issue` and provide as much detail as possible
2. If you're able to address the problem, please indicate this in the issue - we're happy to help you get started with how to do this.
3. If you're not able to address the issue but know where it probably comes from, please leave a hint. This helps people follow up and get a jump start.

Outside of the Mautic product
=============================

Please first report the issue in the relevant Slack channel for the team responsible for the defect you have spotted. They'll then be able to direct you on how best to proceed with reporting the issue and having it addressed.
