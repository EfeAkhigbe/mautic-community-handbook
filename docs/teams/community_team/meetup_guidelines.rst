Guidance for establishing official Mautic meetups, groups & events
##################################################################

The Community Team agreed on 12/12/2019 the following guidelines
for establishing official Mautic groups within the Community.

All meetups, groups, and events agree to abide by the Mautic :xref:`CoC` at all times.

Mautic meetups
**************

These are the traditional kind of in-person meetups, based in a
region or a town. They're **not** created on a country-wide
basis.

General guidelines for official Mautic Meetups
**********************************************

1. Mautic Meetups are for the benefit of the Mautic community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals.
2. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
3. Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
4. Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and should not be used to pay speakers or organizers.
5. Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
6. Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

Official groups have a Meetup group created on the :xref:`Community Portal` and a category created in :xref:`Meetups Forum Category` on the forums once the following criteria are met: 

1. A thread on the Mautic Community Forums in the :xref:`International Forums` category indicating at least two people interested in joining the meetup
2. A clear region or town for the meetup to be based in, not covered by an existing meetup
3. Two group organisers identified from within the Mautic community, preferably not from the same company
4. A location confirmed for meeting which is an office or community space (i.e. not a bar/pub)
5. A date for the launch event (ideally at least four weeks ahead to give time for organising, promoting and getting people to attend)
6. A proposed time and day each month (e.g. from 6pm on the first Friday of each month) for regular events

These events (commonly referred to as “meetups”, which can be confusing since people often use the same word to describe the group itself) might take many formats:

-  presentations/lecture series
-  hackathons
-  social gatherings
-  workshops
-  co-working
-  a session to help people with Mautic
-  contributor sprints/drives, and others.

Existing groups can be brought into the official Mautic Meetup account by contacting the Project Lead. This will mean that the meetup.com fees will be covered by the Mautic Community.

Official Mautic Meetup groups are also eligible for sponsorship by Community Partners - for example to cover the cost of food for a sprint event or to bring in a speaker who needs travel or accommodation.

Mautic Meetups Online
*********************

These are an online variation of the traditional meetup. There are no restrictions on region, and they can span any geographic area.

These meetups will not have a Meetup group (as these must be physical meetups) however they will have a category created in the Mautic Meetups category on the forums through which members can find information and discuss any relevant issues.

Official online Mautic Meetups agree to the same general guidelines as physical meetups (see above).

We currently provide an airmeet.com account to run meetups online for up to 100 attendees.

MautiCamps
**********

Where there is a strong local presence, organizers may wish to create an informal regional event or conference, called a MautiCamp.

These will be regional in nature and organised with support of the Community Team.

Mautic Conferences
******************

We hold annual Mautic Conference events which bring together the international community for a formal conference. Mautic Conference exists in two flavors:

-  Mautic Conference Global, which is held virtually
-  Mautic Conference , real-life, intended to move to a different continent every year.

The first such event took place in 2020 - originally planned as an on-premise event, but converted to a virtual event due to the 2020 pandemic.

Mautic Conference is organised by the community and invites sponsors to support the event. If you are interested in getting involved in any way, please join :xref:`Mauticon Slack` on Slack (get an invitation at :xref:`Mautic Community Slack`).
