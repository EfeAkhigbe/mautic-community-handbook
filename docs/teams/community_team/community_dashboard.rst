Community dashboard
###################

The Community Dashboard uses the open source :xref:`Savannah CRM` tool to import, analyze, and visualize data from multiple sources in one central location.  

You can view the data from the last 90 days on the :xref:`Savannah Dashboard`.

Currently the dashboard imports:

-  All repositories listed under ``github.com/mautic`` 
-  Specified channels from ``mautic.slack.com`` 
-  All threads on ``forum.mautic.org``  
-  All threads on ``reddit.com/r/mautic`` 
-  All Stack Overflow posts tagged with Mautic

Mautic uses this information to determine the activity levels of individuals and organizations within the community, which informs the monthly updates in Slack and the ranking of organizations in the :xref:`Partners' Directory`.
