Community dashboard
###################

The Community Dashboard uses the open-source :xref:`Savannah CRM` tool to import, analyze and visualize data from multiple sources in one central location.

You can view the data from the last 90 days on the :xref:`Savannah Dashboard`.

Currently the dashboad imports:

-  All repositories listed under github.com/mautic
-  Specified channels from mautic.slack.com
-  All threads on forums.mautic.org
-  All threads on reddit.com/r/mautic
-  All Stack Overflow posts tagged with Mautic
-  Specified meetup.com groups (coming soon)

The information is used to determine the activity levels of individuals and organizaitons within the community, which informs the monthly updates in Slack and the ranking of organizations in the :xref:`Partners' Directory`.
