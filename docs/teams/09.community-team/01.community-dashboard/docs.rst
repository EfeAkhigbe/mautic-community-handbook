The Community Dashboard uses the open-source `Savannah
CRM <https://www.savannahhq.com/>`__ tool to import, analyze and
visualize data from multiple sources in one central location.

You can view the data from the last 90 days on the `publicly shared
dashboard <https://savannahcrm.com/public/overview/2b4590bf-cad0-4c71-870a-6f942a25f8fe/>`__.

Currently the dashboad imports:

-  All repositories listed under github.com/mautic
-  Specified channels from mautic.slack.com
-  All threads on forums.mautic.org
-  All threads on reddit.com/r/mautic
-  All Stack Overflow posts tagged with Mautic
-  Specified meetup.com groups (coming soon)

The information is used to determine the activity levels of individuals
and organizaitons within the community, which informs the monthly
updates in Slack and the ranking of organizations in the `Parters
Directory <https://www.mautic.org/mautic-community-partners>`__.
