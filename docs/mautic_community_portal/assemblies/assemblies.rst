Assemblies
##########

In this article we're going to be exploring assemblies, what they are, why they're important, why you might want to get involved with using them, and what you can do.

If you prefer to watch this in video form, you can do that here:

Getting started with Assemblies
*******************************

Assemblies can be found via the link on the main menu. When you access this page you will notice that there are some assemblies which are highlighted, followed by the full list of top level assemblies.

An assembly is a grouping of people who come together to make decisions about specific things or to run different parts of the community.

We have different reasons for having assemblies. So some of them are relating to decision making and governance - such as the Council and the General Assembly - but there are also assemblies for Teams, Meetup Groups and Working Groups as well.

An assembly can also have assemblies nested within it - for example the MautiCon Working Group is nested within the Community Team, because that is the team in which it belongs. This is denoted by the card having a stacked appearance, and listing the number of assemblies within it, as seen in the Community Team here.

Exploring Assemblies
*********************

When you click through onto an assembly you will be presented with the overview page.

1. Where it has been set, there's a hashtag which relates to the specific assembly.
2. The main page for an assembly will provide you with an overview which is basically the charter for that organised group - what they do, and why they exist.
3. If this assembly has a finite time for existence - for example if it exists to support a specific event - this will be listed in the metadata of the page on the right hand side.
4. The follow button is common across the whole of the community portal, allowing you to get updates from assemblies, groups, processes and so forth by clicking the button. Think of it as similar to following on social media pages
5. Each assembly will have a submenu with different components depending on the assembly's need
6. Any upcoming scheduled meetings will show in a list, and where there is an option you will be able to join the meeting by clicking through. After meetings are completed you will be able to view minutes and notes.
7. If an assembly has sub-assemblies they will be listed in this section. Remember that assemblies and sub-assemblies can have assemblies within them!
8. At the very bottom of a page will be some statistics about the assembly.
