How can I try Mautic?
#####################

Mautic is available to download for free [:xref:`Download Mautic`], allowing you to explore its full capabilities without restrictions when you host it yourself.

For optimal performance, we recommend hosting Mautic on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) rather than shared hosting, particularly if you intend to use it in a production setting on lower end hosting which often have limited resources, which may impact Mautic's efficiency and performance.

For further information on setup and hosting recommendations, visit the :xref:`Mautic Documentation`.
