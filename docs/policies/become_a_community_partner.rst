How to become a Mautic partner
########################################

.. vale on

The Mautic Partners Program showcases organizations that are contributing to Mautic - both financially and practically - so that members of the community can find service providers who are :xref:`Makers rather than takers` to work with. These organizations represent the ideals of providing ongoing contributions that open source software rely upon.

How do organizations become a partner?
======================================

There are two elements to consider when reviewing an application to join the Partners Programme, both relate to whether the organization is supporting the community.

Financial contribution
----------------------

.. vale off 

It's required that all Community Partners are financially supporting the growth of the Mautic community as a :xref:`Corporate Member of Mautic`. Members pay for all memberships annually, and via our :xref:`Open Collective`. Prior to v2 of the Mautic governance model which came into effect on ``12th December 2023``, companies who sponsored Mautic at $100 per month or more were also eligible. Companies who were already sponsoring at this tier when the new governance model came into effect and continue to do so are 'grandfathered' in, providing that their sponsorship continues at this tier, for a period of 12 months. This gives them until ``12th December 2024`` to transition to becoming a Corporate Member in order to maintain their status as a Mautic Partner.

Practical contribution
----------------------

Of course money isn't everything, and in fact contributing to Mautic in practical ways, whether that might be through code contributions, leading a team, organizing official events or meetups, contributing to the Documentation resources that we have or working on tasks in one of our five Community Teams are all vital to the growth of our community.

For this reason, organizations who are wishing to become and maintain their status as a Mautic Community Partner must demonstrate regular, meaningful contributions to the Mautic project from their staff.

We measure this in several ways including through the Community Dashboard, reviewing team activity, and engagement in the various projects that teams are running.

Organizations who are not able to demonstrate a consistent contribution history are asked to spend a few months working actively within the community before their application will be considered.
